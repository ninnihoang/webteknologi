        <p>Im a student at NTNU. I am currently taking the course WebTek. I am in my thrid year, studying Industrial Desing, specializing on Intercation desgin. </p> 

        <p> My coding skills are pretty basic. I have taken a course in Python(ITGK) and done some more programming in pythin "Prototyping for Interactive Media" where we coded using an Rasberry Pi. </p>

        <p> I am really looking forward to this course. Even though I am not a master at programming, I find it really interresting to learn how the things you use every day actually works, and how you can do it yourself! </p>

                </li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If my browser is the client in the client server architecture, the server provides the files i see. So the server works as a provider, who transmits and retrieves file to the client. </li>
                    </ol>
                <li><strong>What does the client do?</strong></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The client is the one using the internet, and gain access by using browsers. The browsers can locate and display information from the web. The client requests a web page, then waits for the server to deliver it, and then the browsers renders the package(often an HTML code).</li>
                    </ol>
                <li><strong>What is an IP address?</strong></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>An IP adress is an unique adress for each device connected to the internet. It stands for Internet Protocol adress. </li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>DNS stands for Domain Name Server. A domain name identifies the type of intitution that owns the computer. For example .no is the domain name for norwegain websites. The DNS works as a "phonebook" that map symbolic names (like .no) to their IP adress, so we (humans) dont have to memorize every ip adress when we surf the web.</li>

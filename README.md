Submit a document, written as a web page, containing a structured essay covering the topics
mentioned below. Additionally, to the document, you can create your own CSS style file that you can
use throughout the semester to style these documents.
1. At the top of the document, write your names, as authors, just as you would for any formal
paper together with the date.
2. Administrative details: the name of your client, and his or her position in the organization (or
company), if applicable.
3. The site's purpose and goals and how they will be accomplished. Try to draw a connection
between the goals and the specific content elements of the site.
4. Who is the intended audience or typical user? Describe your audience and their needs.
5. A description of the content of the site and how it is organized. Think of this as the outline of a
paper: it doesn't have to spell out the sentences or even the paragraphs, but it should mention
major sections and even a few salient subsections. In your conference, be prepared to discuss
the site's content, and to explore the feasibility of its design.
6. If known, the server where the site will reside after the project and the names of who will be
responsible for the site maintenance.
The document must be in essay form (paragraphs of text, not just a bullet list or set of bullet lists),
although you may use bullet lists when they are appropriate. It must be written in HTML; not a MS
Word document, PDF file, etc

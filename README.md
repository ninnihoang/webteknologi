Who is the intended audience or typical user? Describe your audience and their needs.

A description of the content of the site and how it is organized. Think of this as the outline of a paper: it doesn't have to spell out the sentences or even the paragraphs, but it should mention major sections and even a few salient subsections. In your conference, be prepared to discuss the site's content, and to explore the feasibility of its design.

If known, the server where the site will reside after the project and the names of who will be responsible for the site maintenance. The document must be in essay form (paragraphs of text, not just a bullet list or set of bullet lists), although you may use bullet lists when they are appropriate. It must be written in HTML; not a MS Word document, PDF file, etc.

Your HTML code for the document page is valid.

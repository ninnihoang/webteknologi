	<h2>Testing Document</h2>
	<p>
		The goal of the usability tests were to evaluate usability of the website,
		and to see if the website met the goals and requirements that we defined
		in the beginning of the project.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>We began with introducing ourselves, and informed the user about the usability test. It is important to remind the user that we are evaluating the system and not the user him–/ herself. We also instructed the user to think–aloud while performing the tasks.</li>
		<li>We gave the user a list of tasks to perform while we simply observed the user and took notes.
			<ol>
				<li>Les den siste workshop–bloggen / Read the last workshop blog post. </li>
				<li>Finn ut hvem som er bedriftskontakt–ansvarlig.</li>
				<li>Søk om workshop / Apply for a workshop.</li>
				<li>Søk om å bli med i Designhjelpen. / Apply to join Designhjelpen.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>We had an open discussion afterwards about the problems that arose during the testing, in addition to general feedback.
			<ol>
				<li>Hva er inntrykket av siden?</li>
				<li>Hva tror du er formålet med siden?</li>
				<li>Er det noe du ville endret på siden?</li>
				<li>Er det noe du mener mangler på siden?</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Lastly, we thanked the user for participating in the usability test.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Tester Audience</h2>
	<p>The target audience is companies and startups, as well as students.
		We tried to reach testers similar to our target audience. In total,
		we did two usability tests: one with the founder of a startup and one with a student.
		Ideally we would like to do 5–8 usability test, but due to limited time, we only had
		time for two people. Despite this, we think that the people we tested where
		representable and we received a lot of useful feedback from the users.</p>


		<h2>Testing Platforms</h2>
		<p>
			We conducted two separate user tests, done with two different web browsers.
			One of the tests were done in Google Chrome and the other in Opera.
			We also tested in Mozilla Firefox and Safari ourselves.<br> <br>The website worked according to plan
			in both Google Chrome and Opera during both of the user tests.<br> <br>After user testing the website,
			a more thorough internal testing was implemented, testing all  five major browsers (Chrome, Firefox,
			Safari, Opera and Internet Explorer (IE11) both on desktop computers as well as their mobile counterparts.
			Although measures had been taken previously to ensure a wide range of browser support (like adding prefixes
			to animations etc.) the website did not look exactly as intended on some. Especially on IE11  the website
			incurred cosmetic blemishes ranging from the main image on the front page not being constrained to the
			screen width  to the navbar-links all clinging together on the left side of the navbar.
			On the browser the recurring problem seemed to be due to width restraints not being recognised,
			or interpreted correctly thus leading to distortions in overall appearance across the pages.
			There were also minor differences from the original when testing on Firefox
			(like padding disappearing from some elements), but these have since been fixed by reverting
			from using percentages to view height to address the padding on these elements.<br><br>
			As of delivery, the website is fully functional and looks according to plan on all major browsers but Internet Explorer, both on desktop and on mobile devices.

		<h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
		<p>We got positive comments on the design. The testers thought that the website looked good. They liked that the navbar was fixed and said that it made it easy and fast to get an overview of the whole webpage. All the testers also highlighted the hover effect on the images on the contact page as fun.
		</p>
		<h3>Design</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The comments on the navigation was that that the website was clear and easy to navigate. The only problem was finding the blog page, but we also got a comment that he liked that the website only highlighted the most important parts so that the website didn’t looked crammed with excess information and that only the people who were interested in reading the blog post would look for it and find it.

			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Content</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>There wasn’t anything about the content that the testers felt needed to be changed. It was simple and straight to the point. The only thing that was pointed out was the post–it note since the users didn’t quite understand the point of the random quotes except for being a neat extra feature.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Usability</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>None of the people we tested understood that the titles on the homepage were links to the other pages on the website. One of the testers didn’t find the blog page at all, and the other one found the blog page, but didn’t understand that the title of the blog posts were links to the full blog.
			</li>
			<li>None of the testers had any problems completing the other tasks.
			</li>
			<li>The button on the post–it notes felt misleading since the tester though that it would lead to another page, not just change the sentence.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Your Response</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>We fixed the problem about the titles as links on the homepage and blog page by adding a hover effect. When you hover over a link a line will appear underneath the title.
			</li>
			<li>The button on the post–it note can be improved by changing the label on the button to something else, for example a refresh symbol. Although our contact at Designhjelpen thought that the post–it note was fun, they will have to make a final decision on whether or not they want to keep it after our project is over.
			</li>
			<li>After the course, we still have to make the forms send an e–mail, but this is of course far beyond the scope of this course.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Self-referection</h2>
		<p>
			The most useful skill we learned other than HTML, CSS and JavaScript was Git (and GitHub) and how to implement it in our workflow as a team. One of the most challenging aspects of the project was to collaborate efficiently when coding. Therefore, before we started coding we took the initiative to learn Git by attending a Git course for beginners arranged by Abakus. We also got help from student assistants along the way, and after some trial and error the whole group got a hang of the basic features.<br><br>
			As the whole group consisted of design students we were all quite familiar with defining requirements, designing and usability testing. The project and course gave us good insight into the technical aspects of making a website. It has also been fun to make something functional for an actual client, as much of what we typically do stops at the concept or prototype stadium. Gaining that experience is valuable for future work, giving us insight into how one might adapt a feature specification into a product. However, considering how few misunderstandings there have been between us and our customer, it is not reasonable to expect later projects to go this smoothly.

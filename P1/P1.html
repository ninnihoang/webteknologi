      The organization specializes in arranging workshop for companies and start-ups, that need design input.
      Designhjelpen consist of 5-10 students mainly from Industrial Design. With feedback from Designhjelpen,
      we are aware of that they have a website today, but it does not cover their needs.
      It is very important for them that their website is easy to use, and look professional,
      because this is the only way companies can contact and learn about Designhjelpen.
